Here lies the code submitted to MIE1210; Intro to computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer at the University of Toronto. 4 Assignments are covered in python, with the final assignment implementing a 2D, finite-volume simulation of the famous lid-driven cavity problem using the SIMPLE algorithm on a co-located mesh. The accompanying reports provide some mathematical background and depictions of the results from each set of code.
