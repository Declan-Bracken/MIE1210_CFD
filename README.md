This repository contains code relevant to MIE1210; Intro to computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer at the University of Toronto. 4 Assignments are covered in python, with the final assignment implementing a 2D, finite-volume simulation of the famous lid-driven cavity problem using the SIMPLE algorithm on a co-located mesh. The accompanying reports provide some mathematical background and depictions of the results from each set of code.

Please examine results from the final 2D solver for the lid-driven cavity problem [here](Declan_Bracken___MIE_1210_A4_Math%20(1).pdf).
